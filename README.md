This is the clone o the ExData_Plotting1 Repository to submit
the first-course assignment.

The assignment uses the data from the following website "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/"
This is a popular repository for machine learning constructed by UC Irvine. 
In particular, the assignment uses the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" 
which the course convener made available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

This Github repo clone contains 8 files. The files include the code for creating each
visualisation/graphic and the graphic itself.

Plot codes:
Plot1.R
Plot2.R
Plot3.R
Plot4.R

Visualisations figures (all are in PNG format)
Plot1.PNG
Plot2.PNG
Plot3.PNG
Plot4.PNG

Each of the plot codes (R files) provides information on how the code works and to reproduce the work.

Thank you for your time and interest.
